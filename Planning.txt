Functions needed:
    - function that returns all the possible choices (empty spaces on the board)
    - function that returns win/loss state
    - function that returns the best move


General path? 

    // main function that returns the best next move
    // if there are no more moves, return the value (1, -1, or 0)
    playTicTacToe(board, player):

        // checks if terminal state, if so return value

        // if not terminal state, must choose a move
        1. Get all the possible moves
        2. For each move: put that move in there, call the function (recursion)
        3. Out of all the moves, choose the best one, return it



So basically, it returns the best move for the given player.
If the game ended, you don't need to call this function, so when playing the actual game
    Either call this function and know the game ended with the score
    Or check for terminal state before calling this function.




TIC TAC TOE BOARD
[
    [ _ _ _ ] // 0, 1, 2
    [ _ _ _ ] // 3, 4, 5
    [ _ _ _ ] // 6, 7, 8
]

arrBoard = [] // length = 9
